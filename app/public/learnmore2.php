            <div class="recipiePreparation2">
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step One</i></b></p>
               <p>Stir together warm milk, brown sugar, and yeast in bowl of standing mixer and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</p>
               <p>Add 3 3/4 cups flour and salt and mix with dough hook at low speed until dough is smooth and very soft, about 7 minutes.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Two</i></b></p>
               <p>Transfer dough to a work surface and knead by hand 2 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, a little at a time, to make a soft, slightly sticky dough.</p>
               <p>Form dough into a roughly 1-1/2-inch-thick rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until cold, about 1 hour.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Three</i></b></p>
               <p>After dough has chilled, arrange sticks of butter horizontally, their sides touching, on a work surface. Pound butter with a rolling pin to soften slightly</p>
               <p>Scrape butter into a block and put on a kitchen towel, then cover with other towel. Pound and roll out on both sides until butter forms a uniform 8 by 5 inch rectangle.</p>
               <p>Chill, wrapped in towels, while rolling out dough.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Four</i></b></p>
               <p>Unwrap dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as necessary and lifting and stretching dough into a 16 by 10 inch rectangle.</p>
               <p> Arrange dough with a short side nearest you. Put butter in center of dough so that long sides of butter are parallel to short sides of dough. </p>
               <p> Fold as you would a letter: bottom third of dough over butter, then top third down over dough. Brush off excess flour with pastry brush.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Five</i></b></p>
               <p>Turn dough so a short side is nearest you, then flatten dough slightly by pressing down horizontally with rolling pin across dough at regular intervals, making uniform impressions.</p>
               <p>Roll out dough into a 15 by 10 inch rectangle, rolling just to but not over ends.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Six</i></b></p>
               <p>Brush off any excess flour. Fold in thirds like a letter, as above, stretching corners to square off dough, forming a 10 by 5 inch rectangle.</p>
               <p>Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour.</p>
               <p style="font-size:27px"><b><i>Step Seven</i></b></p>
               <p>Make 3 more folds in same manner, chilling dough 1 hour after each fold, for a total of 4 folds.</p>
               <p>Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill at least 8 hours but no more than 18</p>
